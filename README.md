```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import imageCompress from 'image-compress'

// using CommonJS modules
var imageCompress = require('image-compress')
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/image-compress/dist/image-compress.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.imageCompress`.

const imageSource = 'http://www.mysite.com/my-image.jpg' // base64 or link

imageCompress(imageSource, {width: 340, height: 340}, 0.4, (file) => {
  console.log(`Image base64: ${file}`);
}, () => {
  console.error('Error!!');
})
